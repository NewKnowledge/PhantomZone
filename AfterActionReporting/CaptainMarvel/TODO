##Analysis:
1. Correlation between discussion of the movie, Larson on 4chan/YouTube channels and review scores
2. Life cycle of the issue on Youtube: did it escalate on 4chan first?  Youtube? Twitter?  Etc
3. Audience threat actor network on YT: we identified a network of channels that are highly focused on Disney IP and are persistent threat actors in the space, analysis of audience overlap with broader alt-right network
4. Discord channels identified

##Findings:
1.  The Youtube influencer network identified also will target Star Wars, Toy Story, etc to promote their ideologies: all are targets of opportunity
2.  The audience that follows these influencers appears to be highly overlapped with conventional alt-right influencers on the platform.
3.  Youtube channels engaging with the "white men" issue appear to have been in a feedback loop with the review manipulation (unlikely they need to directly issue a CTA, audiences knows what to do already)
 (See YT analysis repo for additional data)
4.  Footprint of activities also exists on Reddit - NEED MORE ANALYSIS HERE
 
Threat actor pathway for future Disney movies is likely 4chan/8chan -> Youtube -> Manifestations of CTA
